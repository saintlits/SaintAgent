//
//   - construct a *client.Client themselves, connect it, and pass it via
//     RunOptions.Client (legacy single-connection mode used by native
//     platform embedders); or
//   - pass a *config.Connections store plus a ClientFactory and let the

// In both modes Run is a one-shot blocking invocation; embedders that

	// alias-style field so existing native platform embedders
	// continue to compile. New code should set Backend directly.
	// When both are set, Backend takes precedence.
	Client *client.Client

	// Store is the connections persistence used by the TUI when it
	// owns the connection lifecycle. Setting Store enables the
	// connections picker (entry view + /connections command) and the
	// auth-recovery modals; the program closes the active backend
	// when it exits. Mutually exclusive with Backend / Client.
	Store *config.Connections

	// Initial, when set alongside Store, is the connection the TUI
	// will attempt to use first. A nil Initial drops the user into the

	Initial *config.Connection

	// InitialAgent, when non-empty, instructs the TUI to auto-select
	// the named agent (matched ID-first, then case-insensitive Name)
	// the first time the agent picker loads its list. A miss surfaces
	// as an error banner on the picker rather than silently falling
	// through. Used by `lucinate chat --agent <name>` to drive past
	// the picker without user interaction. The override is one-shot:
	// it is consumed on the first transition that would otherwise
	// have prompted, and cleared on auth-cancel / connect-failure /
	// `/connections` so a subsequent connection's picker is not
	// spuriously filtered against a name from a different scope.
	InitialAgent string

	// InitialSession, when non-empty, overrides the session key the
	// TUI passes to CreateSession on the first agent selection — the
	// `--session <key>` knob from `lucinate chat`. An empty value
	// preserves the existing default ("main", or the connection's
	// MainKey for its default agent). One-shot, cleared in the same

	// ColorProfile, when non-zero, overrides Bubble Tea's automatic
	// colour-profile detection. Bubble Tea inspects Output to decide
	// what palette Lipgloss is allowed to emit; when Output is not a
	// real TTY (an in-process virtual terminal driven by an embedder,
	// say) the auto-detected profile is NoTTY, which strips every SGR
	// sequence and produces a monochrome render. Embedders whose
	// terminal supports colour should set this to the appropriate

	// zero so its existing detection still applies.
	ColorProfile colorprofile.Profile

	// HideInputArea suppresses the chat view's textarea so the embedder
	// can supply its own input surface (for example, a platform-native
	// text field whose typed bytes are written into Input). The
	// underlying textarea model is still updated by the incoming byte
	// stream so command parsing, slash-command autocomplete, history,
	// and Enter-to-send behave exactly as in the CLI; only the textarea
	// view and its border are skipped, and the help line below
	// continues to surface slash-command hints. The CLI never needs

	// Embedders running inside a host that doesn't allow programmatic
	// process termination — a native-platform shell whose OS forbids
	// quitting, where `tea.Quit` would only stop the TUI loop while
	// the host view stays mounted — set this true so the rendered
	// "q quit" footer text and the bound shortcut both disappear
	// together. The CLI, whose user reaches the program through a
	// terminal that can't otherwise dismiss it, leaves this false.
	DisableExitKeys bool

	// DisableMouse stops the program from emitting the
	// alt-screen mouse-tracking enable sequence. Embedders driving the
	// program through a virtual terminal whose host wants to handle
	// pan/swipe gestures natively (translating them into PgUp/PgDown
	// keystrokes for example) should set this so the host's gesture
	// recogniser doesn't capture pans into mouse motion events that the
	// program then ignores. The CLI relies on mouse tracking for
	// selection and should leave it false.
	DisableMouse bool

	// BrightCursor pins the chat composer's textarea cursor on-frame to
	// ANSI 15 (bright white) instead of Bubbles' default ANSI 7 (light
	// grey). Bubbles renders the on-frame as `Style.Reverse(true)` over
	// the cursor cell, so the resulting block's visibility depends
	// entirely on how the terminal maps ANSI index 7. Most desktop
	// terminals render it bright enough to produce a visible block, so
	// the CLI leaves this false and keeps the library default. Embedders
	// driving the program through a virtual terminal whose palette
	// renders ANSI 7 too dimly (the reverse-swapped block then collapses
	// to near-invisible against the dim placeholder character) should
	// set this true; ANSI 15 is bright white on every reasonable palette.
	BrightCursor bool

	// OnInputFocusChanged, if non-nil, is invoked whenever the active
	// view's preferred input mode changes. wantsInput is true when the
	// active view has a focused free-form text input (the chat
	// textarea, the new-agent form fields) and false when only
	// navigation keys are expected (the agent list, the session
	// browser, the config view). The callback fires once during start-up
	// with the initial state so the embedder need not assume a default,
	// and again on every subsequent transition.
	//
	// Embedders on platforms with an on-screen keyboard use this to
	// surface it only when the program actually wants typing, instead
	// of pinning it permanently and losing screen real estate. The
	// callback runs from a tea.Cmd goroutine — embedders that touch UI
	// on a main thread should trampoline accordingly. The CLI leaves
	// it nil.
	OnInputFocusChanged func(wantsInput bool)

	// OnActionsChanged, if non-nil, is invoked whenever the active
	// view's set of exposed Actions changes. The active view is the
	// authoritative source of its discoverable, view-level commands
	// (e.g. "new agent", "back", "retry"); the desktop TUI renders
	// these as inline help and dispatches the bound key, while
	// embedders typically render them as buttons whose tap calls back
	// in via Program.TriggerAction.
	//
	// The callback fires once at start-up with the initial list and
	// again on every transition. It runs from a tea.Cmd goroutine, so
	// embedders that touch UI on a main thread should trampoline
	// accordingly. The CLI leaves it nil — its inline help is the
	// surface that matters there.
	OnActionsChanged func(actions []Action)

	// OnFocusedFieldChanged, if non-nil, is invoked whenever the
	// active view's focused text-input changes — Tab/Shift-Tab inside
	// a multi-field form, or entry into a view that lands focus on a
	// different field. The string is the new field's current value
	// at the moment of transition (empty for a fresh field; pre-fill
	// in Edit mode), so embedders driving an external input surface
	// (a native-platform host's text field, say) can hydrate it to
	// match the TUI state without inventing their own per-field
	// bookkeeping.
	//
	// The callback does not fire on every keystroke — only on field
	// transitions, dedup'd by field identity — so embedders are safe
