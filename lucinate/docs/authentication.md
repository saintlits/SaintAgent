# Authentication

This document covers OpenClaw device pairing — the auth flow used by the OpenClaw backend. The OpenAI-compatible and Hermes backends use a simpler bearer-token model documented in [connections.md](connections.md#auth-recovery-modals) and [connections.md](connections.md#secrets-storage).

For OpenClaw connections, lucinate authenticates using device pairing — no usernames or passwords. Each device generates a persistent Ed25519 keypair and an administrator approves it on the gateway.

## Configuration

OpenClaw URLs can be added via the connections picker (the default UX) or via `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` (auto-added on first run). See [connections.md](connections.md#startup-decision-tree) for the resolution order.

```
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-gateway-host
```

This can be set in the shell or in a `.env` file in the working directory. Lucinate derives the WebSocket endpoint automatically by replacing `https://` with `wss://` (or `http://` with `ws://`) and appending `/ws`. Both values are held in `internal/config/config.go` as `Config.GatewayURL` and `Config.WSURL`.

## Device identity

On first run, `identity.Store.LoadOrGenerate()` creates an Ed25519 keypair under `~/.lucinate/identity/<endpoint>/`, where `<endpoint>` is derived from the gateway URL's host and port (e.g. `gateway.example.com` or `localhost_8789`). Each gateway endpoint gets its own keypair and device token, so switching `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` does not overwrite existing credentials. The keypair acts as a stable device identity across restarts.

## First-run pairing flow

1. Run `lucinate` — the client connects to the gateway with the device identity but no token. The gateway responds `NOT_PAIRED` and registers a pending pairing request.
2. The connecting view enters its `subStatePairingRequired` modal (`internal/tui/connecting.go`) with on-screen instructions. On the gateway host, an administrator approves the device:
   ```
   openclaw device list --pending
   openclaw device approve <device-id>
   ```
3. The user presses Enter in the modal. `authResolvedMsg{}` triggers `retryConnect` (`internal/tui/app.go`), which re-invokes `Connect` on the same backend. The gateway accepts the connection and issues a fresh device token in `hello.Auth.DeviceToken`, which `client.dial` persists via `store.SaveDeviceToken`.
4. `dial` then closes the bootstrap connection and re-dials with the freshly-issued token (see [Re-dial after first-time pairing](#re-dial-after-first-time-pairing)). The TUI advances to the agent picker — no process restart required.

The token save is non-fatal — if it fails, a warning is logged but the session continues. On subsequent runs the saved token is loaded and presented on connect.

**Note:** Bootstrap tokens were removed in v0.10.2. Device pairing is the only setup path.

## Re-dial after first-time pairing

The bootstrap connect for a freshly approved device authenticates by Ed25519 device-key signature alone — the token field on `connect` is empty because the client doesn't have one yet. The gateway issues the first device token in `hello-ok`. Reusing that bootstrap connection for scoped RPCs leaves `sessions.create` silently stalled; the OpenClaw protocol expects scoped operations to run on a connection that authenticated *with* the token at connect time.

`internal/client/client.go` handles this inline: when `dial` observes that it presented an empty token AND the gateway returned a non-empty `hello.Auth.DeviceToken`, it persists the token, closes the bootstrap `gateway.Client`, and dials a second time so the surviving connection carries the issued token. Subsequent launches (token already on disk → bootstrap presents it → gateway returns no new one) skip the second dial. Tests pin both branches in `internal/client/dial_test.go`.

The TUI also wraps `CreateSession` (`internal/tui/app.go`) in a per-call `context.WithTimeout` derived as `2 ×` the configured connect timeout, so any future stall in this region surfaces as a UI error in the agent picker rather than freezing the view.

## Subsequent runs

1. Load `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` from environment, or use a saved connection from `~/.lucinate/connections.json`.
2. Load the Ed25519 identity and stored device token from `~/.lucinate/identity/<endpoint>/`.
3. Open a WebSocket connection to the gateway with the identity and token. The gateway SDK (`github.com/a3tai/openclaw-go`) attaches the token to all API calls.
4. On a successful `Hello` handshake, any refreshed token is saved back to disk; no second dial is needed because the connection already authenticated with a token.
5. Proceed to the agent picker.

If the token is expired or revoked the gateway rejects the connection and the connecting view opens the appropriate auth-recovery modal (see below).

## Interactive auth recovery on connect

When `Connect` fails with a recognised auth error, `runConnect` in `internal/tui/app.go` classifies it via the `isNotPairedErr` / `isTokenMismatchErr` / `isTokenMissingErr` / `isAPIKeyErr` predicates and `handleConnectResult` opens the matching modal sub-state in `internal/tui/connecting.go`:

- **Not paired** (`NOT_PAIRED`) — pairing-required modal: instructions to run `openclaw device approve` on the gateway host, then Enter to retry. See [First-run pairing flow](#first-run-pairing-flow).
- **Token mismatch** (`gateway token mismatch`) — the stored device token is no longer valid for this gateway (for example, the device was removed and re-added). The modal offers three choices, each routed through the `DeviceTokenAuth` sub-interface on the live backend:
  1. Clear the stored token and retry pairing (`ClearToken`, default).
  2. Reset the device identity entirely (new keypair) and retry pairing (`ResetIdentity`).
  3. Cancel back to the connections picker.
- **Token missing** (`gateway token missing`) — text prompt for a pre-shared token; submission stores via `DeviceTokenAuth.StoreToken` and the connect is retried.
- **API key required** (HTTP 401/403 from any `/v1` request on OpenAI-compat or Hermes connections) — text prompt for an API key; submission stores via `APIKeyAuth.StoreAPIKey`.

All four flows happen inside the running TUI — modal text inputs, not stdin. Cancellation routes back to the connections picker; the active backend is closed before the next pick.

## Reconnect after disconnection

Once the TUI is running, a supervisor in `internal/client/supervisor.go` watches the gateway connection (`Client.Done()`) and reconnects automatically if it drops — for example, when the gateway is restarted.

- **Backoff schedule:** 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 15s, then 30s for every subsequent attempt. Each attempt's connect timeout comes from `prefs.ConnectTimeoutSeconds` (default 15s), the same knob that floors the initial connect.
- **State surface:** the supervisor pushes `tui.ConnStateMsg` into the bubbletea program. The chat header shows `⚠ disconnected`, `⟳ reconnecting (attempt N)`, or `✖ auth failed`. A one-line system message is added to the chat scrollback on disconnect and on recovery.
- **In-flight streams:** if a reply was streaming when the connection dropped, the placeholder is cleared so the input is usable again. The gateway has no resume protocol for an interrupted run; the partial reply is abandoned.
- **Auth failures:** if the gateway rejects the device token mid-session (`gateway token mismatch` / `token missing`), the supervisor stops retrying. The chat banner advises switching connections via `/connections` so the connecting view's auth-recovery modal can run on the chosen connection. The supervisor cannot drive the modal itself — that flow lives on the connect path, not the reconnect path.

## Scopes

The client connects with operator-level scopes: `ScopeOperatorRead`, `ScopeOperatorWrite`, `ScopeOperatorAdmin`, and `ScopeOperatorApprovals`. These are set in `internal/client/client.go` and are required for session management, exec approval, and agent administration.
