# Chat UX

## Input key bindings

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Enter | Send message — or, on empty input with an active routine, advance the routine ([routines.md](routines.md)) |
| Alt+Enter | Insert newline |
| Ctrl+W | Delete word backward |
| Up arrow (empty input) | Recall last sent message for editing |
| Tab | Open slash menu, extend to longest common prefix, then cycle |
| Shift+Tab | While slash-menu is cycling: cycle backward through candidates. Otherwise, with an active routine: cycle the routine's mode (auto ↔ manual) |
| Page Up / Page Down | Scroll message history |
| Esc | Cancel in-progress response — or, with an active routine, end the routine and (if streaming) cancel the turn |

Alt+Enter is configured via `ta.KeyMap.InsertNewline.SetKeys("alt+enter")` in `chat.go`. Shift+Enter is not supported — `ReportAllKeysAsEscapeCodes` is disabled to preserve shifted punctuation input.

## Message recall

When the textarea is empty and the user presses Up arrow, the last entry in `m.pendingMessages` is popped and inserted into the textarea with the cursor at the end. This allows editing and resending a recently queued message without retyping it.

## Streaming animation

When a message is sent, an assistant message with `streaming: true` is appended to the display immediately so there is always visible feedback. A braille spinner (`⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏`) animates at 120 ms intervals via `spinnerTickCmd()`. Each frame increments `m.spinnerFrame` and re-renders the last message line.

As delta events arrive from the gateway, the message content is built up in place. When the final event arrives, `streaming` is set to false and the spinner stops. If the final event arrives before any delta (empty response), the placeholder is removed from the display entirely.

The same spinner also decorates pending system rows (`chatMessage.pending`) — the in-flight placeholders posted by `/compact` and `/reset` after confirmation. `hasStreamingMessage()` treats any pending system row as a reason to keep ticking, and the result handler swaps the placeholder for the outcome via `replacePendingSystem` so the spinner is replaced in place rather than appended after. See [commands.md](commands.md#confirmation-pattern) for the wiring.

See [message-rendering.md](message-rendering.md#streaming-placeholder) for the rendering side of this.

## Thinking levels

The gateway supports extended thinking for supported models. The level is stored in `m.thinkingLevel` and displayed in the header bar when set and not `"off"`.

Valid levels: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`.

`/think` (no argument) shows the current level. `/think <level>` validates the input and calls `client.SessionPatchThinking(sessionKey, level)`. See [commands.md](commands.md) for the command dispatch.

The spinner also appears while the model is thinking before any response deltas arrive, giving immediate feedback after sending.

## Header bar

The header line shows:

- **Left:** agent name · model ID (last path component) · thinking level (if set and not `off`) · connection status (only when not connected) · update-available badge (only when `prefs.UpdateChecksEnabled()` and the startup check found a newer release)
- **Right:** context usage (`tokens: 65k/1.0m (7%)  $0.42`) when the gateway has reported a context window for the active session; otherwise the legacy `tokens: 125.5K (2.3K cached)  $0.42` shape.

Two independent loads feed the right-hand side:

- `loadContextUsage()` populates `m.promptTokens` and `m.contextWindow`. It calls `SessionsList(agentID)`, finds the entry whose `key` matches `m.sessionKey`, and reads `totalTokens` (numerator — a per-turn prompt-token snapshot of `input + cacheRead + cacheWrite`, intentionally excluding output) and `contextTokens` (denominator), falling back to `defaults.contextTokens` when the entry omits the window. This is what makes the percentage scoped to the *current session*; the older approach of calling `SessionUsage("")` returned gateway-wide aggregates and pegged the value at 999%. The cmd refreshes on chat init, on every `historyRefreshMsg` (so the percentage tracks turn-by-turn), and on `modelSwitchedMsg` (a new model can change the window). The handler discards results whose `sessionKey` no longer matches `m.sessionKey` so a navigated-away-and-back race can't apply a stale snapshot.
- `loadStats()` continues to call `client.SessionUsage()` for the cumulative cost figure shown on the right of the header (and for the `/stats` table). The percentage display falls back to its token+cache layout when `loadContextUsage` hasn't produced a window yet.

The renderer caps the percentage at 999% so a runaway numerator never widens the header past three digits.

The connection-status badge is rendered in the error colour and only appears when the gateway connection is degraded:

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `⚠ disconnected` | The supervisor has just observed the WebSocket close; reconnect not yet attempted. |
| `⟳ reconnecting` (or `attempt N`) | A reconnect attempt is in progress. The attempt counter is shown from the second attempt onwards. |
| `✖ auth failed` | The gateway rejected the device token mid-session. The supervisor has stopped retrying — open `/connections` and re-pick the same connection so the connecting view's auth-recovery modal can prompt for a fix. |

A matching one-line system message is also added to the chat scrollback on disconnect (`Lost gateway connection — attempting to reconnect…`) and on recovery (`Reconnected to gateway.`) so the event is visible even after the badge clears. See [authentication.md](authentication.md#reconnect-after-disconnection) for the full lifecycle.

### Update-available badge

A second header badge — `↑ vX.Y.Z`, rendered in the same warn style as `⚠ disconnected` — appears when the daily startup update check finds a newer release. The check is owned by `internal/update`: a single `GET https://lucinate.ai/latest.json` with a 5-second timeout, fired once per day from `AppModel.Init()`. Anything goes wrong (offline, captive portal, malformed manifest, non-stable build) and `update.Check` returns `nil, nil` — no badge, no error.

The badge is suppressed once the user has seen it: `prefs.LatestSeenVersion` records the manifest version on every successful check, and the badge only appears when the manifest moves *past* that version. Toggle the whole thing off via the `Check for updates on startup` row in `/config`, or set `LUCINATE_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK=1` for an unconditional opt-out (useful in CI). The manifest URL itself can be overridden via `LUCINATE_UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL` for local testing.

## Notifications

Ephemeral state messages — confirmation prompts, cancel acks, routine state changes ([routines.md](routines.md)) — render as one or more rows above the input box, between the conversation viewport (or completion menu) and the routine status row when present. Each row is width-padded and styled with `statusStyle` (or `errorStyle` for is-error rows).

The store is `chatModel.notifications []notification` (`internal/tui/notifications.go`). Notifications live outside `m.messages`, so they survive `historyRefreshMsg` and never reach the gateway. They are cleared at the top of the Enter handler whenever the user submits a non-empty input, and on the empty-Enter routine-advance path — the assumption is that any state worth showing in a notification has been read or no longer applies once the user takes their next action.

`m.notify(text)`, `m.notifyError(text)`, and `m.clearNotifications()` are the only entry points; each calls `applyLayout()` so the conversation viewport reflows when notifications appear or disappear. Empty text is dropped silently so callers can `notify(maybeFmt(...))` without a guard.

This replaced the older pattern of appending `chatMessage{role:"system"}` rows for transient state. Persistent client-side rows (the inline `! cmd` / `!! cmd` shell-execution scrollback, gateway connect/disconnect notes, the `/help` / `/stats` / `/skills` info dumps) still go in `m.messages` because their value is in being scrollable history, not in a one-shot read.

## Routine status row

When `m.activeRoutine != nil`, a single styled row renders immediately above the input box:

```
routine: demo — AUTO — sent: 5/10 — next: <40-char preview>
```

`AUTO`/`MANUAL` reflects the controller's mode; `(paused)` is appended when `paused` is set. The row is sourced by `routineStatusLine()` and styled by `routineStatusStyle` in `routines_chat.go`. `applyLayout()` subtracts one from the viewport height when a routine is active, mirroring the notification-row accounting. See [routines.md](routines.md) for the full controller surface.

## Tool call cards

When the agent invokes a tool, an inline status card appears in the scrollback between assistant messages — name, one-line argument summary, and a state glyph that animates while running and resolves to ✓ or ✖. Lucinate opts into the `tool-events` capability on connect; backends without tool events (e.g. the OpenAI-compatible adapter) simply never emit them. Tool output bodies are not yet expandable — see [message-rendering.md](message-rendering.md#tool-call-cards) for the rendering contract and the open follow-up for an expand/collapse affordance.

## History depth

The number of messages loaded from the gateway on session init is configurable. The default is 50. It can be changed via `/config` ("History limit") in steps of 10 (range 10–500). The value is stored in `prefs.HistoryLimit` and passed to `loadHistory()` as the fetch limit.

When restored history is non-empty, a dimmed separator row is rendered above the new turn, labelled with the relative time of the most recent restored message (`Resumed from 2h ago`, `…`). The label comes from `formatSeparatorLabel` (`render.go`), driven by the `timestampMs` field on the synthetic separator `chatMessage`. See [message-rendering.md](message-rendering.md#message-roles) for the role.

See [sessions.md](sessions.md#lifecycle) for how history loading fits into the session lifecycle.

## Mid-turn history resync

After a turn finalises, the chat view fetches `chat.history` from the gateway and merges it into `m.messages`. The merge is *not* a wholesale replacement — that would wipe live state (the next routine step's placeholder, an in-flight tool card, a system row the user just took an action on).

The mechanism is a generation counter:

- `chatModel.gen` is a monotonically increasing `uint64` (starts at 1).
- Every `appendMessage(...)` stamps the current `m.gen` onto the row.
- A successful `final` (or `error`/`aborted`) calls `bumpGen()`, which captures the current value as the "boundary" and then advances the counter. The boundary is what the just-issued `refreshHistoryAt(boundary)` carries.
- When the resulting `historyRefreshMsg` lands, `mergeHistoryRefresh(server, boundary)` keeps every existing row with `gen > boundary` (the live tail — appended by the post-bump `drainQueue` / `maybeAdvanceRoutine` / recovery path) and prepends the server-fetched canonical state.

Practical consequences:

- Rows imported from `chat.history` carry `gen=0` (the chatMessage zero value), so any subsequent refresh treats them as history-side and replaces them cleanly.
- Tool cards from the *just-finalised* turn are lost on refresh — the gateway's history view doesn't model them. Tool cards for the *current* (next) turn survive because they're tagged with the new gen at append time.
- Empty `final` acks (the gateway ping that arrives before any real content) intentionally do NOT bump the gen, because no turn has actually completed.

Tests pin the contract: `TestMergeHistoryRefresh_PreservesLiveTail`, `TestMergeHistoryRefresh_NoLiveTail`, `TestHandleEvent_FinalBumpsGen`, `TestHandleEvent_FinalEmptyAckDoesNotBumpGen`.

## Connect timeout

Each (re)connect attempt has a per-attempt deadline applied to the WebSocket / HTTP handshake. The default is 15 seconds; the range is 5–300 seconds via `/config` ("Connect timeout"). The configured value is loaded by `app.DefaultBackendFactory` (`app/factory.go`) for every backend dispatch, so the same setting governs the initial connect and the supervisor's reconnect attempts. Bump it when targeting a slow local LLM that cold-starts on first request.

## Scrolling

The message history is a Bubble Tea viewport. Mouse wheel events are forwarded to the viewport directly. Page Up/Down and arrow keys scroll when the input is not the active focus. New messages are anchored to the bottom via `GotoBottom()` after each update.
